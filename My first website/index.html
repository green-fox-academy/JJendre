    <p1>Have you ever wondered what makes a great web page design? You are on the right place.
       I enjoy to design webpages with complex levels of automation. 
       I love to inventing new things that can augment the humen experience. <br><br></p1>

    <h3>Logic gate</h3>
    <p2>It is an idealized or     physical device implementing a Boolean function; that is, 
      it performs a logical operation on one or more binary inputs and produces a single binary output.</p2>
    <h3>ASCII</h3>
    <p2> It stands for American Standard Code for Information Interchange. 
      Computers can only understand numbers, so it is the numerical representation of a character such as 'a' or '@' or an action of some sort.</p2>
    <h3>Random-access memory</h3>
    <p2> It is a form of computer data storage which stores frequently used 
      program instructions to increase the general speed of a system. 
      It can be randomly accessed. Data items to be read or written in almost the same amount of time irrespective of the physical location of data
       inside the memory.</p2>
    <h3>Programming language</h3>
    <p2>A formal language that specifies a set of instructions that can be used to produce various kinds of output. They generally consist of

    <h3>Instruction set</h3>
    <p2>All computers run using very low-level commands which do some very basic functions,
         such as reading data, jumping to addresses, and calculating basic arithmetic. 
         (The complete list of commands that can be run by a CPU is known as that</p2>
