If you can read these lines, I am a genius!!!!  :) In any case
// Write a function called countLines() that takes a filename as string as a parameter
// and returns the number of lines the file contains.
// It should return zero if it can't open the file, and
// should not raise any error.
 Write a program that opens a file called "my-file.txt" and prints
 each line from the file.
 If the program is unable to read the file (for example it does not exist),
 it should print the following error message: "Unable to read file: my-file.txt"
